# Coin Picking Robot
The objective of this project was to design a robot that can detect and pick up coins. The
robot operates in a predefined perimeter which is created using AC current carrying wires. The
robot is made using a folded chassis, servo motors, and servo wheels. It has an electromagnet on
an arm controlled by servo motors that is used to pick up the coin. A microcontroller was used to
control the various circuitry components to operate the robot.
